    "The relationship (tie) among the above characters (actors) detected (automatically) here is the so-called \"conversational relationship\" which is defined whenever two characters are co-participating in a conversation. Actually, due to the structure of Shakespeare's printed text (in Project Gutenberg), the unit of conversation (or conversational chunk) used here is the body of the text which is delimited between two empty lines. In this way, the resulting network is represented by a weighted undirected graph, where tha weight of a edge joining two characters is the total number of conversational chaunks that these characters are involved in. Moreover, we are decomposing the network into slices (or layers) according to one of the five Acts during which the measured coversations take place."
